Cleaned version of FBI NICS Background Check Data

I extracted and cleaned the data from https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year_by_state.pdf/view

Each row represents the number of background checks recorded in a given state/territory for a given month between November 1998 and June 2020.
